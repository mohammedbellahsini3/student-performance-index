# Create Web Application for student performance : 
# Project Description:
Welcome to the Student Performance Estimation Web Application! This endeavor showcases a web application created using Flask, with a focus on predicting student academic performance. Through the utilization of various predictive modeling techniques and the assessment of outcomes using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared), this platform strives to deliver precise and enlightening forecasts for student achievements.
# steps of project :
 ## 1.Data Preprocessing and Model Training:
 The data employed in this project underwent preparation and refinement through the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook. Subsequently, the model_training.ipynb notebook was utilized to train the Multiple Linear Regression model using the processed dataset.
 ## 2.Building machine learning model for web application:
we Buil machine learning model for the web application by using multiple lineare regression that  is a statistical technique used in data analysis and predictive modeling to establish relationships between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. 
## 3.Evaluation Metrics:
The effectiveness of the developed model is assessed using metrics like the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. These measures serve to gauge the precision and success of the predictions. Remarkably, the model achieves an impressive accuracy level of 98%, indicating its proficiency in capturing and explaining the observed patterns in the data.
## 4.Frontend Developement:

The user interface of the web application was crafted through the adept combination of HTML and CSS. These technologies synergized to bring forth an interface that seamlessly integrates aesthetics and functionality, ensuring an engaging and user-centric experience.
